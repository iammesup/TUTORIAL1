"""
Python has two primitive loop commands:
    while loops
    for loops
"""
"""
The while Loop
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true."""
"""in for loop it repeat untill the content will complete in the list,tuple or set
but while loop repeat untill the condition is true."""
"""
The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 0
"""
"""the syntax is written as while(condition):"""
#for example:while(i<45):
"""
i=0
while(i<45):
    print(i)#it never stop it runs.......
"""
i=0
while(i<45):#it print upto 44 and then stops because the condition will become false 
    print(i)
    i=i+1
