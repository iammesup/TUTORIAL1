Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
Operator 	Name 	        Example 	
+ 	      Addition 	     x + y 	
- 	      Subtraction  	 x - y 	
* 	      Multiplication x * y 	
/ 	      Division       x / y 	
% 	      Modulus 	     x % y 	
** 	      Exponentiation x ** y 	
// 	      Floor division x // y

Python Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
Operator 	Example 	Same As 	
=        	x = 5 	  x = 5 	
+=       	x += 3 	  x = x + 3 	
-= 	      x -= 3 	  x = x - 3 	
*= 	      x *= 3 	  x = x * 3 	
/= 	      x /= 3 	  x = x / 3 	
%= 	      x %= 3 	  x = x % 3 	
//= 	    x //= 3 	x = x // 3 	
**= 	    x **= 3 	x = x ** 3 	
&= 	      x &= 3 	  x = x & 3 	
|= 	      x |= 3 	  x = x | 3 	
^=       	x ^= 3 	  x = x ^ 3 	
>>= 	    x >>= 3 	x = x >> 3 	
<<= 	    x <<= 3 	x = x << 3 	

Python Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
Operator 	Name 	                  Example 	
== 	     Equal 	                  x == y 	
!= 	     Not equal 	              x != y 	
> 	     Greater than 	          x > y 	
< 	     Less than 	              x < y 	
>= 	     Greater than or equal to x >= y 	
<= 	     Less than or equal to 	x <= y
