Public, Private & Protected Access Specifiers | Python Tutorials For Absolute Beginners In Hindi #63
In high-level programming languages like C++, Java, etc., private, protected and public keywords are used to control the access of class members or variables. However, Python has no such keywords. Python uses a convention of prefixing the name of the variable or method with a single underscore(_) or double underscore(__) to emulate the behaviour of protected and private access specifiers.

Access modifiers are used for the restrictions of access any other class has on the particular class and its variables and methods. In other words, access modifiers decide whether other classes can use the variables or functions of a specific class or not. The arrangement of private and protected access variables or method ensures the principle of data encapsulation. In Python, there are three types of access modifiers.

Public Access Modifier
Protected Access Modifier
Private Access Modifier
Public Access Modifier:
In public, all the functions, variables, methods can be used publicly. Meaning, every other class can access them easily without any restriction. Public members are generally methods declared in a class that is accessible from outside the class. Any ordinary class is by default, a public class. So, all the classes we had made till now in the previous tutorials were all public by default.
