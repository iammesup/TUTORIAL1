Python Conditions and If statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

    Equals: a == b
    Not Equals: a != b
    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b
The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
