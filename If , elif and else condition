Python Conditions and If statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
IF WE USE if THEN PYTHON IT CHECKS ALL THE LINE LINE BY LINE ALSO AFTER THE CONDITION GET SATISFIED
    Equals: a == b
    Not Equals: a != b
    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b

The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
BUT IF WE USE elif THAN IT CHECKS THE LINE AND 
IF THE CONDITION GETS SATISFIED THEN DIRECTLY 
PRINT THE OUTPUT RATHER THAN CHECKING OTHER LINES (ITS HEPLS TO MAKE THE PROGRAM FAST)
The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
